# Survival Analysis for Deep Learning

This is a [tutorial on survival analysis](https://k-d-w.org/blog/2019/07/survival-analysis-for-deep-learning/), also referred to as time-to-event analysis or reliability analysis. You will learn how to train a convolutional neural network to predict time to a (generated) event from MNIST images, using a loss function specific to survival analysis.
